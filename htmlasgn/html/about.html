Studio 84 is a INDIA-based , established in Reading in 1990 by partners Mark Barratt and Sue Walker.
We use our experience in language, design, systems and process improvement to deal with communication issues in a way that is focused on users. We work in print and electronic media, and specialise in explaining things through:
clear language

process analysis.
We have a core team with skills ranging from copywriting and editing for clear language, to form design for print and screen, to structured documents for parallel publishing.
In addition we can call on experts and consultants who provide support in specific areas such as database-driven websites, and electronic forms.
We have contacts in the industry with complementary skills enabling us to further increase our resources on an as-needed basis.
